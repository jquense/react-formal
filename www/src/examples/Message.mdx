Form `<Message>` displays error state for a field or set of fields. They
can be rendered anywhere under a `<Form>` and styled to suit your application.

## Overview

`<Message>`s like `<Field>`s associate and subscribe to paths with the form data.
Following the api for HTML `<label>` the `for` prop is used instead of `name`.
Messages only render when there are errors.

```tsx
import * as yup from "yup";
import Form from "react-formal";

<Form errors={{ name: "I am an Error" }}>
  <Form.Message for="name" />
</Form>;
```

Messages can be configured to display one, or all errors pertaining to a field

```tsx
import * as yup from "yup";
import Form from "react-formal";

<Form errors={{ name: ["I am an Error", "I am a second error!"] }}>
  <Form.Message for="name" />

  <hr className="my-3" />

  <Form.Message for="name">
    {errors => <span>{errors.pop()}</span>}
  </Form.Message>
</Form>;
```

Messages are also not limited to a single field:

```tsx
import * as yup from "yup";
import Form from "react-formal";

<Form errors={{ name: "Name is required", age: "age is required" }}>
  <Form.Message for={["name", "age"]} />
</Form>;
```

React formal is unopinionated about how errors should be styled. You can easily
add your own styles to the Message or create a wrapper component for your application.

```tsx
import * as yup from "yup";
import Form from "react-formal";

function InfoMessage(props) {
  return <Form.Message className="text-warning font-bold ml-4" {...props} />;
}

<Form errors={{ name: "Required" }}>
  <Form.Message
    for="name"
    className="text-danger bg-danger-light px-4 py-3 rounded border border-danger"
  />

  <InfoMessage for="name" />
</Form>;
```
