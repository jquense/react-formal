The `<NestedForm>` component is a specialized Form, that allows encapsulating
complex Fields into isolated resuable Form components of their own that can
be used independent of a parent Form.

# Overview

`<NestedForm>` is functionally the same a normal `<Form>` when used by itself.
When used in the context of a larger Form, though it is responsible for managing
the state of a single branch of the overall form value.

The challange with resuable form fields is that one needs to provide a `name`
to each Field and names must be an "absolute" path to a piece of form data. This
makes it hard to reparent a field component elsewhere because any nested field
will continue to point to the old path. NestedForm, allows you to build Field's
with relative paths instead.

Consider a common case of shipping and billing addresses. The logic and UI is basically
the same for each, even tho the data points to different place:

```jsx
import * as yup from 'yup';
import { Form, NestedForm } from 'react-formal';
import { UsaStates } from 'usa-states';

const { states } = new UsaStates();

const addressSchema = yup.object({
  address: yup.string().required('Required'),
  city: yup.string().required('Required'),
  state: yup.string().oneOf(states.map((s) => s.abbreviation)),
  postalCode: yup
    .string()
    .matches(/\d{5}/, 'Must be a valid zip code'),
});

const schema = yup.object({
  title: yup.string(),
  shippingAddress: addressSchema,
  billingAddress: addressSchema,
});

const AddressField = ({ name }) => (
  <NestedForm name={name}>
    <label>
      Address
      <Form.Field name="address" />
      <Form.Message for="address" className="error" />
    </label>

    <div className="flex">
      <label className="flex-1">
        City
        <Form.Field name="city" />
        <Form.Message for="city" className="error" />
      </label>
      <label className="mx-3">
        Postal Code
        <Form.Field name="postalCode" />
        <Form.Message for="postalCode" className="error" />
      </label>
      <label>
        State
        <Form.Field name="state" as="select">
          {states.map((state) => (
            <option
              value={state.abbreviation}
              key={state.abbreviation}
            >
              {state.name}
            </option>
          ))}
        </Form.Field>
        <Form.Message for="state" className="error" />
      </label>
    </div>
  </NestedForm>
);

<>
  <Form schema={schema}>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Shipping Address</legend>
      <AddressField name="shippingAddress" />
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Billing Address</legend>
      <AddressField name="billingAddress" />
    </fieldset>
  </Form>
</>;
```

Unless overridden `<NestedForm>` will inherit configuration from its parent Form,
so you don't need to provide a schema, but are welcome too if convenient.
