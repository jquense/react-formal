## Getting Started

Lets install both `react-formal` and `yup`.

```sh
npm install react-formal yup
```

> For older browsers without the `Promise` as well as `Set` and `Map` global object, you'll need to include
> a polyfill such as `es6-promise`, or `core-js`.

## Creating a Form

React Formal consolidates and tracks form state. Input values are mapped
to an overall form value via their `name`. It works very similar to how you might serialize
a native HTML form.

```jsx live
import Form from '@docs/components/FormWithResult';

<Form noValidate defaultValue={{ age: 25, name: 'Jane Doe' }}>
  <label>
    Who are you?
    <Form.Field name="name" />
  </label>
  <label>
    How old are you?
    <Form.Field name="age" type="number" />
  </label>
</Form>;
```

Forms are made up of `<Field>`s, and you can use almost any component as
a field. The only expectation React Formal has it that the field component accept a `value`
and report changes by calling an injected `onChange` callback. It's the same
contract as plain controlled inputs in React.

The example below is a single form `Field` made up of an input and button.

```jsx live
import Form from '@docs/components/FormWithResult';

const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();

const AgeInput = ({ name, meta, value, ...props }) => {
  const handleClear = () => {
    meta.onChange(null);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input
        {...props}
        type="number"
        value={value || ''}
        min="1900"
        max={currentYear}
      />
      {value && (
        <p>
          born: {currentYear - value}{' '}
          <button type="button" onClick={handleClear}>
            clear
          </button>
        </p>
      )}
    </>
  );
};

<Form noValidate defaultValue={{ age: 64 }}>
  <label>
    Enter your age:
    <Form.Field as={AgeInput} name="age" />
  </label>
</Form>;
```

Passing React Formal `onChange` handlers to native inputs will Just Work. The target
`value` is pulled from the event correctly and passed up. However, you **do not** need to pass
an event, and can instead pass the input `value` by itself.

## Adding Validation

Most forms need some sort of value validation. Sometimes is simple, but often it
can get very complex. In order to handle all the cases React Formal relies on `yup`,
a small, schema-based. validation library. For more infomation about how schema
affect forms see: [Form Schema](/api/Form#schema).

A schema, tells each form how and where to validate it's inputs, hit submit to
see the issue here:

```jsx live
import Form from '@docs/components/FormWithErrors';
import * as yup from 'yup';

const schema = yup.object({
  name: yup.string().required(),
});

<Form schema={schema}>
  <label>
    Enter your name:
    <Form.Field name="name" />
  </label>
  <Form.Message name="name" className="error" />
  <Form.Submit>Submit</Form.Submit>
</Form>;
```

You can easily control how and and when fields trigger validation as well. Consult
the `FormSubmit` and `Field` API docs for more infomation.

## Submitting a form

Once a form is complete it's time to submit it, collect the form data and maybe
save it to a server. You've already seen the `<Form.Submit>` component above, which
triggers a form wide validation.

```jsx live
import Form from 'react-formal';
import * as yup from 'yup';

const schema = yup.object({
  name: yup.string().required(),
});

const handleSubmit = (formData) => {
  alert(JSON.stringify(formData, null, 2));
};

<Form schema={schema} onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <label>
    Enter your name:
    <Form.Field name="name" />
  </label>
  <Form.Message for="name" className="error" />
  <Form.Submit>Submit</Form.Submit>
</Form>;
```

When you click `Submit` the form enters a "submitting" phase while it runs validation
again. If validation succeeds an `onSubmit` callback will fire. After which React Formal
considers the submission finished and is ready to continue processing input.

React Formal gives you additional hooks to control how submission works. For instance
you may want your Submit buttons to provide feadback while saving data to the server.
`submitForm` allows you do do async work while the Form waits for you to finish.
In this example we change the button text to "submitting…" while saving
the form data to a server.

```jsx live
import Form, { useFormSubmit } from 'react-formal';
import fakeSaveToServer from '../fakeSaveToServer';
import * as yup from 'yup';

const schema = yup.object({
  name: yup.string().required(),
});

const submitForm = async (formData) => {
  await fakeSaveToServer(formData);
};

const Submit = () => {
  const [submit, submitMeta] = useFormSubmit();

  return (
    <button type="submit" onClick={submit}>
      {submitMeta.submitting
        ? 'Submitting…'
        : `Submit ${submitMeta.submitCount ? '✓' : ''}`}
    </button>
  );
};

<Form
  schema={schema}
  submitForm={submitForm}
  defaultValue={{ name: 'Jane Doe' }}
>
  <label>
    Enter your name:
    <Form.Field name="name" />
  </label>
  <Form.Message for="name" className="error" />
  <Submit>Submit</Submit>
</Form>;
```

And that's the basics of how React Formal works. Consult the [API](/api/Form) documentation
for more tips and tricks.
